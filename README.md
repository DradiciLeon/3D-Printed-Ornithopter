This is a work in progres prototipe of a flying bird almost fully 3D printed.
At the moment it uses one brushless motor, an 20 A ESC, a 11.1 V Li-Po battery and
a speed controller.
Future goals: -adding a second motor because the wings are not moving at the same rate
              -modifying the wings to be more resistant
              -smoothing out the movement
              -try to get to the point where it produces thrust

Code is not required for this version
