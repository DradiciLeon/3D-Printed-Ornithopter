Flying Bird Prototype

Work in Progress

This repository contains the prototype of a nearly fully 3D-printed flying bird. The project aims to create a functional flapping-wing mechanism that can eventually generate thrust.

Current Setup

Motor: 1x Brushless motor

ESC: 20A Electronic Speed Controller

Battery: 11.1V Li-Po

Control: Speed controller

Future Goals

Add a second motor to ensure synchronized wing movement

Strengthen the wings for better durability

Improve movement smoothness

Achieve thrust production

At this stage, the project does not include code, as the primary focus is on the mechanical and structural aspects.
